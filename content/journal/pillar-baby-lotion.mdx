**TL;DR:** Choose a lightweight, fragrance‑light lotion with occlusives and humectants. Avoid harsh fragrance, parabens, phthalates, and strong dyes. Patch‑test first.

## Why babies need a lotion
- Newborn skin is thinner and loses moisture faster.

## Ingredient checklist
- **Humectants:** Glycerin, panthenol, sodium PCA.
- **Emollients:** Caprylic/capric triglyceride, balanced natural oils.
- **Soothers:** Oat, aloe, calendula.

## Routine: when and how to apply
- After bath (within 3 minutes), on damp skin. Spot‑apply on dry patches.
